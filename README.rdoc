== TL Mafia Queue

I developed this application to help organize game flow for the TeamLiquid Mafia community.  In our community, we were constantly hosting mafia games consisting of 11-30 players, and since many people wanted to host, we needed to develop a system to determine who would host at what times so that the forum was not flooded with everyone's ideas all at once.

Our initial approach was to use a manually managed queue system on a first-come first-served basis based on the game category.  I created this app to help automate the queue into a dynamic system that would let people host games based on popularity of the particular setup rather than having a first-come first-served system for hosting.  Unfortunately, the project didn't work out as hoped because of internal politics and the difficulty of integration with the site we were actually playing on.

The live version of the app still remains on http://tlmafiaqueue.herokuapp.com
